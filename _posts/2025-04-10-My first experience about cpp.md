title: My first experience about cpp

After writing some Cpp code, I'm starting to thinking 

I was a software engineer with 3 years of experience of java, and then 2 years' studying as a computer science student in Msc. 

I started to learn C++ recently because I want to do some serious database developing job. But I find it very struggling with even a toy vector class with copy constructor/copy assignment. 
The problem I found so far : 
1. Bad tools support. I'm writing code with Zed which has native support for cpp with clangd. Zed itself is indeed a beautiful well crafted editor. But clangd really suck. 
2. Few direction of best practice 
3. Hard to understand the concept
